# To-Do List app

This is a web-based to-do list application created with `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) was used as the bundler of Javascript modules.

## Features

 - Create a to-do item to the default project (My Project) or a custom project
 - Update a to-do item
 - Delete a to-do item
 - Create a custom project
 - Set a priority for each to-do item (low, medium, or high)
 - All data saved to `localStorage`

There are two main links to the left tab section which are:

1. Due Today - this will show all tasks/to-do items that are due for today
2. Projects - this will show all to-do items in a certain project
